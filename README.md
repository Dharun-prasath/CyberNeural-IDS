# CyberNeural-IDS 🔐

**CyberNeural-IDS** is a **Hybrid Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** 
that combines **CNN + LSTM** for known attack classification 
and **Autoencoder** for detecting **zero-day (unknown) attacks** 
with **real-time LAN monitoring**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Hybrid Deep Learning (CNN + LSTM + Autoencoder)**
- ✅ **Detects Known & Unknown Attacks (Zero-Day)**
- ✅ **Real-Time LAN Traffic Monitoring**
- ✅ **Severity-Based Alerts (Low/Medium/High)**
- ✅ **Adaptive Learning for Future Attack Patterns**
